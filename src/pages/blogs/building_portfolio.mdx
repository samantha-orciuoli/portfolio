I’m thrilled to share that I have officially embarked on a new chapter in my academic and professional career: pursuing
a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at Austin. This opportunity represents a pivotal
moment in my journey, allowing me to immerse myself in the rapidly evolving field of AI and prepare for the exciting
challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Why AI?

Artificial Intelligence has always captivated my interest. The ability to create intelligent systems that can learn,
adapt, and solve complex problems offers endless potential for innovation and progress. With a strong foundation in
Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration, I’ve developed both the technical skills and strategic mindset
to apply AI solutions in impactful ways. However, as AI continues to evolve, I am eager to gain a deeper, more advanced
understanding of this fascinating field.

What I Hope to Achieve

Through this program, I aim to develop a comprehensive mastery of AI techniques, including machine learning and natural
language processing, while engaging in innovative research that pushes the boundaries of what is possible. I am also
excited to explore how AI can be applied to real-world business challenges, leveraging my background in business
administration to bridge the gap between technology and strategy. Ultimately, I hope to build meaningful connections
with peers, faculty, and industry leaders, expanding my professional network and opening doors to new opportunities.

Looking Ahead

Starting this program marks the beginning of an exciting journey — one that I am eager to embrace with energy,
curiosity, and determination. I look forward to sharing my progress and insights as I navigate the world of Artificial
Intelligence and continue to explore its vast potential.
